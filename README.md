# kpem-flux
KPEM (Kai and Preston Encrypted Messenger) is a simple standard for encrypted messaging. It is designed for maximum interoperability while still maintaining protcol support for a large featureset.
KPEM uses an AES encrypted JSON message format, and does *not* support peer to peer connections.
kpem-flux is my open-source kpem client, and is bundled with kpem-aberrate, my KPEM server.
